Built a C program that encrypts a text file.

The text file goes through 2 iterations of encryption, with both adding a key onto the encryption for added security.

After the 2 iterations of encryption algorithm, a new encrypted file will be created.

-Example:

---Data in Hello.txt file:

Hello, have a great day and enjoy the weather!

---The encrypted file might look something like the following depending on what keys are used:

zW^^]ZSDWSU@WSFVSKS\VW\X]KFZWEWSFZW@

---Then when you decrypt the file, encrypt.txt, it should return back to:

Hello, have a great day and enjoy the weather!
